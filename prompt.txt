have a look to the Stern-1 project and the stacks-langauage (/lexV2.py, /parseV2.py and asm/incl/stacks_runtime.asm) as runtime library. look in STACKS/src directory for examples in the Stacks language

I like to extend the Stack-language with a ARRAY datatype

About the lentgh and size question, i like declare an size (max index) and keep track of the length. The length can be stored at index 0 (quick acces) and the maxsize must be protected and can be stored at index 1.

STEP 1> Prepare lexer

STEP 2> To declare an Array: 
Syntax: ARRAY <name_of_array> size      
eg ARRAY my_array 10, will create an array of memory size size+2



STEP 3> to writing:
Syntax: value index AS [name_of_array]. 
will write the value at index of the array

or
Syntax: value AS name_of_array
will append the value to the array

the compilers (/parseV3.py) is aware of the typing of the AS construction, value AS var, and VALUE as connection are valid types (vars and connections) the array-type must fit in this schema. it does or it write a var, or a connection, or a ARRAY from now on

STEP 4> to read: 
For a value read from the array to TOS, the index is on TOS. 
Syntax: 3 [name_of_array]  
eg will read the thirt value of the array from memory and place it on TAS

For reading the lenght, (just) name_of_array will put the lenght on TOS 
Syntax: name_of_array

step-by-step

Step 1: lexV2.py, done
step 2: parser must handle ARRAY definition ARRAY name size, done
step 3: write to/append to a array using the AS statement, done
step 4: read from index /read lentgh of a ARRAY, done
step 5: identify (all) the runtime routines: @stacks_array_write, @stacks_array_append, @stacks_array_read, @stacks_array_length. done

step 6: implementing @stacks_array_length

* All diffs must be from the current baseline


This is not correct, the first token can be ident_name or a '['

if ident_name in self.arrays:
            # Peek at the *next* token to distinguish read length vs indexed read
            if self.checkPeek(TokenType.OPENBL):
                # Syntax: index [array_name] (Read at index)
                # The index is already on the stack (pushed by the preceding expression)
